# toaq.gay

toaq.gay is a funny little website for the constructed language *Toaq*.

We host [a course]({{<relref "/docs/course">}}) for learning Toaq concisely,
and [a blog]({{<relref "/posts">}}) for Toaq related things (mostly from Nano).

There are also toki pona translations for (mostly) everything! You can change the language in the dropdown to the left.
